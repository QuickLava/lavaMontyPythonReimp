	<!--The list of modifications to check through while applying this patch.-->
	<modifications>
		<!--Mod: An individual modification. When a mod is triggered, all of its "actions" will be executed on the target parameter, in order from top to bottom.-->
		<!--Match: The parameter value that needs to be found in order to trigger this modification.-->
		<!--Notably, an 'X' is treated as a wildcard, and will match anything in that slot.-->
		<!--ExtraCondition: Specifies an extra condition which must be met in order for the mod to be applied.-->
		<!--  0: Does nothing. This is the value used when no value is provided, though it may also be used to explicitly disable this feature.-->
		<!--  1: Requires that the mod immediately preceding this one was triggered.-->
		<!--  2: Requires that the mod immediately preceding this one was NOT triggered.-->
		<!--Lock: This acts as a mask, preventing changes to the original values of digits in any slot marked with a 1.-->
		<!--So, for instance, a lock mask of "11110000" will lock a value's top 4 digits, ensuring that they are unchanged by any actions in this modification. -->
		<!--In the event that either parameter (match or lock) is not a full 8 characters long, it's front will be padded with zeroes (eg. "101" will become "00000101").-->
		<!--ParamIndexRedirect: This can be used to cause actions to be instead taken on some other parameter of this function, rather than on the one which triggered the match.-->
		<!--If a value is not explicitly provided this feature is disabled, though it may also be explicitly disabled by providing an index below 0.-->

			<!--Type: Defines the action to be taken.-->
			<!--  0: Does nothing. Useful if you just want the program to print matches to the console without modifying them.-->
			<!--  1: Replaces the found value with the provided one.-->
			<!--  2: Adds the provided value to the target one.-->
			<!--  3: Subtracts the provided value *from* the target one.-->
			<!--  4: Multiplies the target value into the provided one.-->
			<!--  5: Divides the target value by the provided one.-->
			<!--  6: Bitwise ANDs the provided value into the target value.-->
			<!--  7: Bitwise ORs the provided value into the target value.-->
			<!--  8: Bitwise XORs the provided value into the target value.-->
