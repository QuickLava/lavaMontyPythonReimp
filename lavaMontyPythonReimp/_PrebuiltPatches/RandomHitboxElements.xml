<!--This patch demonstrates the use of the RAND Action (0x01) on a bitflag parameter.-->
<!--Note: We'll be editing Hitbox flags in this patch, which requires a bit of foreknowledge.-->

		<!--We aren't concerned with the value of this parameter, since we're just going to be randomizing part of it.-->
		<!--So, to make sure this mod always triggers, we'll use "XXXXXXXX" as our "match", and the default evalCondition "0" (==).-->
		<!--Also note the "lock" value. In this Mod, we're only changing the sound of this hitbox, so we only wanna change the last 5 bits of the Flag param.-->
		<!--So, in our "lock" value (0xFFFFFFE0), all but the last 5 bits are set, which ensures that all but those bits are left alone (ie. locked). -->
		<mod match = "XXXXXXXX" lock = "FFFFFFE0">
			<!--Because we want a random effect, and there are 24 effects (0x18 in hex), we'll use Action "type" 0x01 (RAND) with a "value" of 0x18.-->
			<action type = "0x01" value = "00000018"/>
			<!--Note that while, technically, this replaces the whole param value, all but the last 5 bits will be set back to normal thanks to our "lock" value.-->
		</mod>
		<!--And that's it, we're done! Applying this patch will randomize the element of all of a character's hitboxes.-->
