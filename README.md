# lavaMontyPythonReimp
A Reimplementation and Expansion of [Montimers' Sound Remapper](https://github.com/Montimers/monty_python). Critically, this implementation allows for the application of a variety of chainable manipulations to any parameter in any subaction event in a moveset file without the need for any programming.

See [the program's wiki](https://github.com/QuickLava/lavaMontyPythonReimp/wiki) for documentation and operating instructions.
