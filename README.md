# lavaMontyPythonReimp
A Reimplementation and Expansion of [Montimers' Sound Remapper](https://github.com/Montimers/monty_python). Critically, this implementation allows for the application of a variety of chainable manipulations to any attribute or parameter in any subaction event in a moveset file without the need for any programming.

See the program's wiki for documentation and operating instructions.
